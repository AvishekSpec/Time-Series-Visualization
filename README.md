# Time-Series-Visualization
This project is a **Time Series Visualizer** that analyzes and visualizes the daily page views of the freeCodeCamp forum from May 2016 to December 2019. It uses Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing time series data to identify trends, patterns, and seasonality in the daily page views of the freeCodeCamp forum. The dataset is cleaned to remove outliers, and three types of visualizations are created:

1. **Line Plot**: Shows the trend of daily page views over time.
2. **Bar Plot**: Displays the average page views per month, grouped by year.
3. **Box Plot**: Highlights the distribution of page views, both year-wise and month-wise.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Removes outliers by filtering out the top and bottom 2.5% of the data.
- **Line Plot**: Visualizes the trend of daily page views over time.
- **Bar Plot**: Compares average monthly page views across different years.
- **Box Plot**: Analyzes the distribution of page views to identify trends and seasonality.
